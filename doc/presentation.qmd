### Introduction
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Gene expression dataset (Golub et al.)
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Original experiment aimed for Machine Learning approach
- Aim: Compare the two groups

### Materials and Methods
- 72 patient
- 7129 genes
- Combined training and test dataset
- Normalization



---


#### Results - Differential expression heatmap {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: r-fit-text
-   Linear modelling applied to find change in expression between ALL (0) and AML (1)
-   Using q-value \< 0.05, significantly differentially expressed genes were filtered
-   50 gene names were filtered based on highest and lowest estimated expression change\
-   Heatmap shows normalized expression differences

### Results - PCA {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
- 59 PCs explain 95% of variance in the data, top 2 - 26%
- PCA data points stratified by cancer type.
- PC1 - AML points spread out, ALL points more clustered
- PC2 - ALL points spread out, AML points more clustered.
