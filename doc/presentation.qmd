### Introduction
- Gene expression dataset (Golub et al.)
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Original experiment aimed for Machine Learning approach
- Aim: Compare the two groups

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Linear modelling applied to find change in expression between ALL (0) and AML (1)
- Using q-value < 0.05, significantly differentially expressed genes were filtered
- 50 gene names were filtered based on highest and lowest estimated expression change  
- Heatmap shows normalized expression differences
