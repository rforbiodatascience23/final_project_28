### Results - Differential expression heatmap {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
- Linear modelling applied to find change in expression between ALL (0) and AML (1)
- Using q-value < 0.05, significantly differentially expressed genes were filtered
- 50 gene names were filtered based on highest and lowest estimated expression change  
- Heatmap shows normalized expression differences
